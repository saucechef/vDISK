EXAMPLES:

help                                    // Displays available commands and their usage.
hexdump 0x800 65536                     // This would dump the first copy of the FAT provided the formatting parameters are normal.
cd /dir1                                // Change from current working directory into subdirectory "dir1".
cd ..                                   // Go up one level.
ls                                      // Lists the content of current working directory.
mkdir /dir2                             // Creates new directory "dir2" in current working directory.
cp file1.txt file2.txt                  // Copies a file to another location.
mv file1.txt file2.txt                  // Moves a file from one location to another. Can also be used to rename file.
getinfo file1.txt                       // Prints info of "file1.txt".
getinfo_fat16                           // Prints all available info about the drive and its FAT16 partition.
wrfile testfile.txt                     // Copies physical file "testfile.txt" into current working directory.
exfile file1.txt                        // Extracts file and writes it to physical file under same name.
rm /test                                // Removes directory "test" and all its content recursively.
getfrag                                 // Gets fragmentation status of virtual FAT16 partition in percent.
defrag                                  // Defrags virtual FAT16 partition.
savedisk disk2                          // Saves disk-image of vDrive to "disk2.img" (extension is added automatically).
loaddisk disk1.img                      // Loads disk-image into vDrive (extension is NOT added automatically).
format fat16 "TESTDRIVE"                // Will format vDrive with a FAT16 partition with 4 sectors per cluster and 128 sectors per fat.
quit                                    // Ends the program.
