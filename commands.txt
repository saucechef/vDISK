EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATIONS:

help                          - Displays available commands and their usage.
hexdump 0x800 65536           - This would dump the first copy of the FAT provided the formatting parameters are normal.
cd dir1                      - Change from current working directory into subdirectory "dir1".
cd ..                         - Go up one level.
ls                            - Lists the content of current working directory.
mkdir dir2                    - Creates new directory "dir2" in current working directory.
cp file1.txt file2.txt        - Copies a file to another location.
mv file1.txt file2.txt        - Moves a file from one location to another. Can also be used to rename file.
file-getinfo file1.txt        - Prints info of "file1.txt".
fat16-getinfo                 - Prints all available info about the drive and its FAT16 partition.
wrfile file.txt test.txt      - Copies physical file "file.txt" into current working directory under name "test.txt".
exfile test.txt file.txt      - Extracts file and writes it to physical file.
rm test                       - Removes directory "test". CAUTION: DOES NOT REMOVE RECURSIVELY.
getfrag                       - Gets fragmentation status of virtual FAT16 partition in percent.
defrag                        - Defrags virtual FAT16 partition.
savedisk disk2                - Saves disk-image of vDrive to "disk2.img" (extension is added automatically).
loaddisk disk1.img            - Loads disk-image into vDrive (extension is NOT added automatically).
format fat16 TESTDRIVE        - Will format vDrive with a FAT16 partition with 4 sectors per cluster and 128 sectors per fat.
newdrive 16777216             - Creates new drive with 16MiB of Storage.
quit                          - Ends the program.
